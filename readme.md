# Workhour-Tracker

an uncomlete project, that allows users to log themselves in, if they exist in the user database and then enter their workhours into a table.

the projects are as of now still given by javascript, and users must be added directly in the SQL-Database 

```
cp php/connect.dist.php php/connect.php
nano php/connect.php
```
